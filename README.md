# GM_Kalman
The aim of the project design a Gaussian Mixture Kalman filter and estimate position of the car from noisy measurements. This project implemented by using Forney-style factor graphs. My main responsibility implement a reduction algorithm inside the Kalman Filter to reduce extensive calculation caused by Gaussian Mixture.
